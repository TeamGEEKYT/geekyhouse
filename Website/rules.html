        <p>Livestream Rules</p>
    </header>

    <!-- Explainations -->
    <p>On my channel, as long as you are nice and follow YouTube TOS, you should be fine.</p>
    <p>Yet, remembering you some points shouldn't hurt you.</p>

    <br>

    <!-- Rules -->
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Liberty of speech</h1>
        <p>You can talk about anything you want, as long as:</p>
        <p>- You don't hurt or mean to someone or me</p>
        <p>- You are not political</p>
        <p>- You don't advertise yourself without my permission</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Ban Bypassing</h1>
        <p>Bypassing a ban is an Instant Perm Ban onto your alt account, and a longer ban period will be applied if it was not an permanent one.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Raiding</h1>
        <p>Feel free to raid me on Twitch.</p>
        <p>However, don't raid me if you just want to ruin the Livestream.</p>
        <p>The streamer that raided me won't be punished if the raid wasn't meant to ruin the livestream.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Spam</h1>
        <p>Feel free to spam at important parts... But don't when it is just me talking to you or when a random, yet non-interesting event happens.</p>
    </div>
    
    <br>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Moderation</h1>
        <p>The moderation team has to mute/ban users that breaks the rules.</p>
        <p>If a moderator punishes someone that does not break the rule or that does not punish someone who breaks them might be unmodded if this was done intentionaly.</p>
    </div>
