        <br>
        <p>- Because humans take too much time to learn a level</p>
        <p>- Because humans are breaking GD</p>
        <p>- Because recent tab would be better</p>
        <p>- Because Robtop wants it... no?</p>
        <p>- (5th reason here)</p>
        <p>- Because Finity's better than nobody actually</p>
        <p>- AIs > Humans</p>
        <p>- Because they don't have to focus</p>
        <p>- Because they won't break anything because of GD</p>
